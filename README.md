I created this project to practice Typescript syntax and also re-vamp my Angular concepts:

1. TypeScript syntax
2. Compiling TS → JS
3. Object-oriented concepts in TypeScript

   
Make sure you have Node.js installed.

To install project dependencies:
npm install

Below are the commands used to run the individual files in the project

1. npx tsc Student.ts
2. node Student.js

npx tsc -init is used to generate the tsconfig.json file
